# clickyGame

This memory game is built with React.js, using the creat-react-app and ES6 JavaScript.

This simple game allows users to pick an image and the more images they select without clicking on images they've already selected, their score goes up.  However, if they click on an image that they've already chosen, the score is reset.  The app also logs the users highest top score.
